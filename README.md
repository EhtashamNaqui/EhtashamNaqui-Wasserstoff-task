6 : How I approached the task -

I have prior knowledge of react.That's why  it was easy for me to start.
I created the react file with vite.where I created different components and downloaded the assets like logo from the figma file.
then I proceeded with the developement and you can see my work.
however during the process due to lack of time I can't complete it on time but hopefully 
the judging criteria will judge me on the basis of the design and hardwork.
